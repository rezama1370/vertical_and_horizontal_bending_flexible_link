This dataset are collected from the field test site at Tampere University. The inertial sensors were based on an ADIS16485 iSensor chip, which measures angular velocities (range ±450◦/sec) and accelerations (range ±5g) with respect to three different axes.

The data has been used to produce the result of the paper entitled "Chaotic inertial sensor-based state estimation of flexible links in the presence of vertical and horizontal dynamic bending: Design and experimental evaluation", which has been submitted to the journal "Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing".

The measurement of different IMUs are given in following form:
          
          1) H20: Horizontal bending with 20 kg load mass
          2) H40: Horizontal bending with 40 kg load mass
          3) V20: Vertical bending with 20 kg load mass
          4) V40: Vertical bending with 40 kg load mass
